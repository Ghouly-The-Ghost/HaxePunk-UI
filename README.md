HaxePunk-UI is a port of the FlashPunk 
[punk.ui](https://github.com/RichardMarks/punk.ui) project. Because it runs on 
HaxePunk, it's cross-platform and uses accelerated rendering.

This is a work in progress with known issues. The original version of
Haxepunk-UI is available in the legacy branch.

# Please Note
This upgrade is a work in progress. It is not usable for production but will be hopefully soon.
There's a bit more work to do but you can actually see some results already.

# How To Use

You should have HaxePunk's dependencies and Haxe V3.4.7 installed already.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Ghouly-The-Ghost/HaxePunk-UI.git`
2. Make sure you're on the 4.1 upgrade branch.
3. Install HaxePunk-UI in haxelib from this branch: `haxelib git HaxePunk-UI https://github.com/Ghouly-The-Ghost/HaxePunk-UI.git HP4.1-Upgrade`
4. Go into the demo folder and run: `haxelib run lime test neko`
